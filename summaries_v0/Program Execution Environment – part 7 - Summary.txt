  Position Independent Code (PIC) is a method used to place relocations from the text section into the data section. This is accomplished by moving the relocations into a Global Offset Table (GOT). The GOT is used to hold the absolute addresses of variables, ensuring that the text section remains unchanged. PIC is commonly used in shared libraries, where the goal is to share the text section among multiple processes. By moving relocations into the data section, multiple processes can share the text section without conflicts. Additionally, the use of PIC ensures that the relocated data is located in the data section, making it easier to manage and less prone to errors. Overall, PIC is a powerful technique that helps ensure efficient use of memory and improved reliability in shared libraries.
