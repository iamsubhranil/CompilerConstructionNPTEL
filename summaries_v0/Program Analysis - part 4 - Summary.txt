 The speaker is discussing data flow analysis in computer science, specifically focusing on four classical problems: reaching definitions, available expressions, live variable analysis, and very busy expressions. These problems involve analyzing the flow of data and control through a program to determine various properties of interest. To illustrate these concepts, the speaker describes a token-based approach to data flow analysis, where tokens are generated at definition sites and flow through the program according to the control flow graph. Tokens are copied and duplicated when control flow splits, and killed when a redefinition occurs. The set of definitions reaching a given location is equivalent to the set of tokens present at that location.

To perform data flow analysis, the speaker proposes a unidirectional flow of tokens, starting from the entry point of the program and proceeding forward. The analysis consists of two parts: a local phase and a global phase. In the local phase, the program is divided into basic blocks, and for each basic block, the sets of generated and killed definitions are determined. These sets are called "local sets" because they only require examining the individual basic block to compute. Using the local sets, a set of global solution sets is constructed, which provides information about the definitions reaching the beginning and end of each basic block. The global solution sets are computed recursively, taking the union of the out-sets of the predecessors for the in-set of a given basic block, and computing the out-set as the difference between the gen-set and the kill-set of the basic block.

Using this framework, the speaker explains how to solve the four classical data flow analysis problems mentioned above. For reaching definitions, the goal is to determine the set of definitions that can reach a given location. The solution is the set of tokens present at that location, which corresponds to the in-set of the basic block containing the location. For available expressions, the goal is to determine the set of expressions that are certainly defined at a given location. The solution is the set of tokens that have been generated and have not been killed by a subsequent definition. Live variable analysis seeks to determine the set of variables that are used on at least one path from a given location to the program exit. The solution is the set of variables that are alive at the given location. Finally, very busy expressions identify expressions that are computed in every possible path from a given location to the program exit. The solution is the set of tokens that correspond to the given expression and are generated at every basic block along the path.

Overall, data flow analysis is a powerful tool for understanding the behavior of programs and enabling various optimizations. By analyzing the flow of data and control through a program, it is possible to determine valuable information about the program's behavior and make informed decisions about how to optimize it.
