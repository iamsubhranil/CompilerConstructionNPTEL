 The text describes a more sophisticated code generation scheme compared to a simple code generation scheme discussed previously. Instead of generating code for each intermediate statement individually, this scheme involves constructing a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for a basic block and then generating code for the entire block based on the DAG. The advantage of this approach is that it considers the entire basic block, allowing for optimizations such as common sub-expression elimination. Each node in the DAG represents a unique identifier, such as a variable or constant, and interior nodes represent operations such as addition or multiplication. To generate code for the DAG, a sequence ID is assigned to each node, indicating the order in which they should be processed. An example is provided to illustrate the process.
