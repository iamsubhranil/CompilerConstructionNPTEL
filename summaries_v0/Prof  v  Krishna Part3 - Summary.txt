 Compiler optimization aims to improve the performance of a program without altering its functionality. Control flow analysis is a crucial aspect of optimization, involving the construction of control flow graphs (CFG) to represent the flow of control in a program. Each node in a CFG represents a basic block, a sequence of instructions with no jumps within it. Edges in a CFG connect basic blocks and indicate the flow of control.

Dominator analysis is a fundamental component of control flow analysis, determining the dominance relations among blocks. Dominators play a vital role in finding loops and extracting natural loops from a CFG. Unreachable code elimination is a beneficial outcome of control flow analysis, discarding code segments that are not part of any execution path.

Control flow optimization focuses on generating larger basic blocks, offering several advantages, including improved local optimizations, enhanced instruction-level parallelism (ILP), and better pipelining. Techniques employed in control flow optimization include code straightening, simplification, and loop inversion.
