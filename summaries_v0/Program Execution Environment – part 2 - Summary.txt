 Variable Length Arrays (VLAs) were introduced in C99 and allow arrays to be declared with a size determined at runtime. However, determining the offset of VLAs during execution presents challenges due to their dynamic nature. Stack allocation is commonly used for VLAs, requiring dynamic adjustment of the stack pointer as the program runs. Implementing VLAs on the heap involves using `malloc` and `free`, but stack allocation remains more efficient for smaller arrays. Understanding the stack layout and interaction between base pointer and stack pointer can aid in effectively using VLAs.
