 An assembler is a program that transforms assembly code into machine code. During this transformation, the assembler assigns absolute addresses to labels and generates relocation entries for symbols that require modification. Relocation entries instruct the linker on how to adjust certain memory locations in the object file to match the actual memory addresses assigned during the linking phase. The linker uses the relocation entries to update the machine code with the actual memory addresses of the symbols, allowing the assembled object files to correctly interact with each other in the final executable.
