 Shared libraries, also known as dynamic shared objects (DSOs) in Linux or dynamic link libraries (DLLs) in Windows, are object files that can be loaded at runtime and are not linked statically in an executable. They allow for efficient use of memory by avoiding code duplication and enable easier bug fixing and updating, as only one copy of the library needs to be updated rather than requiring every program that uses it to be recompiled. Shared libraries can be loaded at arbitrary memory locations, and their loading and linking is handled by the dynamic linker. However, using shared libraries introduces some overhead during application load time, as relocations need to be resolved. Position independent code (PIC) can be used to mitigate this issue, enabling the shared library to be loaded at any address without needing modifications. This is achieved through the use of an additional level of indirection called the Global Offset Table (GOT), which holds the absolute addresses of variables used in the code. Compiler optimizations and careful planning can minimize the impact of this extra layer of indirection.
