 The speaker is discussing the use of the LLVM compiler infrastructure for performing program analysis and optimization. They explain that LLVM uses a separation of concerns approach, where the front end converts source code into LLVM Intermediate Representation (IR), the optimization passes perform various analyses and transformations on the IR, and the back end generates machine code for a specific target platform. The speaker demonstrates how to use the `clang` tool to compile a C program into LLVM IR, and how to use the `opt` tool to apply optimization passes to the IR. They also discuss how to write custom optimization passes as shared libraries and load them into LLVM using the `-load` flag. Finally, they mention that they will cover data flow analysis and control flow analysis in upcoming sessions.
