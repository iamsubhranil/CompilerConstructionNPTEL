 Dataflow analysis is a technique used in compilers to analyze properties of a program's control flow graph (CFG), focusing on the movement of data throughout the program. Constant propagation is a popular dataflow analysis that aims to determine the constant values of variables at each point in the program. However, constant propagation is not distributive over meets, meaning that the order in which the flow functions are applied can affect the result. Therefore, choosing the optimal order of optimizations is crucial for achieving good performance. Conditional constant propagation is an extension of the basic algorithm that only explores paths in the CFG that are likely to be taken, improving efficiency. Optimizations are usually performed in several passes, and determining when to stop can depend on factors such as available compilation time and the presence of conflicting optimizations. Constant propagation is just one of many optimizations performed by compilers, which aim to transform high-level code into efficient machine code.
