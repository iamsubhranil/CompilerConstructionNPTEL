 Program Analysis is the process of understanding interesting properties about a program. This can be done through dynamic analysis, where extra code (like print statements) is added and the program is executed on certain inputs to observe its behavior, or through static analysis, where the program is analyzed without executing it. Static analysis can be done by dry running the program (simulating an execution) or by examining the program text and trying to understand its functionality without running it. The purpose of program analysis can be to debug a program, understand what the program is doing and what causes bugs, verify whether a program meets certain requirements, or optimize a program's performance. Program analysis can be used to identify potential issues in a program, such as security vulnerabilities or performance bottlenecks. It can also be used to provide input to other tools or processes, such as automated test case generation or code refactoring. Overall, program analysis plays a crucial role in ensuring the reliability, safety, and efficiency of modern software systems.
