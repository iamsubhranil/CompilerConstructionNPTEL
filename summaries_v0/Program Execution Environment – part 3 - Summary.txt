 An object file is a file containing machine code produced by an assembler along with related data. Object files are typically in binary form and contain instructions, data, and metadata necessary for linking. Metadata includes information on what is defined and referenced in the object file, allowing the linker to merge inputs together. Object files can be categorized as relocatable, executable, or shared based on their purpose. Common object file formats include COFF, PE, and ELF, with ELF being the primary focus in this class. Tools such as objdump, nm, readelf, and dumpbin can be used to examine object files.
