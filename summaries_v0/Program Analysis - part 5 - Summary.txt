 Reaching Definition Analysis is a forward, any path analysis that determines which definitions reach a specific point in a program. It aims to find the smallest solution, where the size of the sets is minimized. Available Expressions Analysis is similar, but the goal is to find the largest solution. This analysis can be used for redundancy elimination, where unnecessary computations are removed. The algorithm for Available Expressions Analysis is similar to that of Reaching Definitions Analysis, but the global equations and transfer function are different. The direction is also forward, and it can be either an any path or all path analysis. The desired solution can vary based on the application.
