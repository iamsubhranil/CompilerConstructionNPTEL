Explanation:

* C++ Inheritance: A mechanism in C++ where one class can acquire the properties and characteristics of another class.
* Data Memory and Code Memory: Separate regions in memory responsible for storing data and code, respectively.
* Static Stack and Heap: Specific areas in memory for automatic and dynamic memory allocation.
* Aloka Instruction: An LLVM IR instruction that allocates memory on the stack.
* GEP Instruction: An LLVM IR instruction that computes a pointer to an element or a struct field, given a base pointer and offset.
* Store Instruction: An LLVM IR instruction that writes a value to a memory location.
* Translating Virtual Function Calls: Converting virtual function calls into direct function calls during code generation.
* Internal Representation of a Class: The organized structure of class members (data and functions) in memory.
* Private Members: Class members that are accessible only within the class.
* Public Members: Class members that are accessible outside the class.
* This Pointer: A hidden pointer to the current object, automatically passed as the first argument to non-static methods.
* Inheritance Hierarchy: A tree-like structure representing relationships between parent and child classes.
* Non-Virtual Functions: Member functions that perform the same action regardless of the object type.
* Virtual Functions: Member functions that behave differently depending on the object type.
* Pure Virtual Functions: Virtual functions without implementation, forcing derived classes to provide their own implementation.
* Abstract Class: A class containing at least one pure virtual function, which cannot be instantiated.
* Virtual Function Table: A table containing addresses of virtual functions, used to support polymorphism and dynamic dispatch.
* Compile Time: The stage in which the source code is processed and transformed into machine code before execution.
* Runtime: The stage during which the program is actively executing.
* Indirect Calls: Function calls involving pointers or references, resolving to the target function during runtime.
* Direct Calls: Function calls explicitly stating the target function, resolved during compile time.
* Call Graph: A graphical representation of function calls and their interactions in a program.
* Interprocedural Optimizations: Optimization techniques that analyze and transform multiple procedures simultaneously to improve performance.
