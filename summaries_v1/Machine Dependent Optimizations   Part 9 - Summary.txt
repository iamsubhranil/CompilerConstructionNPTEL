 **Modulo Reservation Table:**
	* A table used in software pipelining to model resource constraints.
	* Has ii columns and f rows, where f is the number of resources.
	* Records a sequence of reservations for each entry.

**Scheduling Operations:**
	* An operation is scheduled at time step t if t mod ii falls within the modulo reservation table.
	* Satisfying resource constraints involves ensuring there are no conflicts in the modulo reservation table.

**Heuristic Approach:**
	* Uses earliest start time and latest start time to prioritize scheduling.
	* Attempts to schedule nodes with less slack first.

**Register Requirements in Modulo Scheduling:**
	* Multiple live ranges can cause register allocation issues.
	* Rotating registers or splitting live ranges can alleviate these issues.

**Memory Hierarchy Optimizations:**
	* Cache hierarchies consist of multiple levels, including L1, L2, and L3 caches.
	* Memory access time is influenced by hit time, miss rate, and miss penalty.

**Cache Organizations:**
	* Direct mapped cache: each memory block maps to a unique cache location.
	* Associative cache: each block can be placed in any cache location within a set.
	* Set associative cache: each block maps to a unique set, with multiple possible locations within that set.

**Types of Cache Misses:**
	* Cold misses (compulsory): occur when accessing a block for the first time.
	* Capacity misses: occur when the cache runs out of capacity.
	* Conflict misses: occur due to insufficient associativity causing collisions.

**Direct Mapped Cache Example:**
	* Given a 16 KB cache with 32-byte blocks, there are 512 cache blocks and 9 index bits.
	* Addresses are divided into offset bits, index bits, and tag bits.

**Set Associative Cache Example:**
	* Divides cache blocks into sets, with each memory block uniquely mapped to a set.
	* Within a set, there are multiple possible locations for a block.

**Programmer Perspective on Caches:**
	* Understanding how caches affect program behavior.
	* Direct mapped cache example illustrates cache behavior.
