**Concepts:**

- Continuing from the previous lectures, the presentation introduces a dynamic programming approach for optimal code generation of trees.
- The cost of generating code for an operation is the sum of the costs of generating code for its subtrees and the cost of the instruction itself.
- The problem exhibits the optimal substructure property, making it suitable for dynamic programming.
- During the code generation process, some results may be temporarily stored in memory due to limited register availability.
- The method computes the cost of generating code for each node considering varying register counts (from 0 to R) and memory storage.
- Each node stores an array of R+1 elements representing the minimum cost for each register count and memory storage.
- The overall cost is calculated in a bottom-up manner, starting from the leaves of the tree.
- The memoization strategy ensures the tree is traversed only once, yielding a cost calculation with a complexity proportional to the number of nodes in the tree.
