 Object Files:

Object files contain machine code generated by the assembler along with related data. They are typically stored in binary format for efficient processing by the linker. Key components of an object file include:

1. Machine code: Encoded instructions, such as MOV, in binary format.
2. Initialized data: Global variables that have initial values assigned.
3. Uninitialized data (bss): Global variables that are not explicitly initialized and have a default value of zero.
4. Read-only data (rodata): String literals and constant data.

Types of Object Files:

There are three primary types of object files:

1. *Relocatable Object File*: Generated by the assembler or compiler, this type of object file represents code that is not yet ready to run. It may have external references that need to be resolved by a linker.

2. *Executable Object File*: After linking, this type of object file is ready to run. It has all dependencies resolved and can be loaded into memory for execution.

3. *Shared Object File*: Used for creating dynamic link libraries (e.g., .dll on Windows or .so on Linux). Shared objects can be loaded and linked at runtime.

Binary File Formats:

Different platforms use different object file formats. Examples include COFF, PE, ELF, and MachO. Format selection depends on the target platform and the desired features.

Tools for Examining Object Files:

Various utilities exist for examining object files, including:

- `objdump`: Capable of disassembling object files and providing detailed information about their contents. Works with multiple object file formats.
- `nm`: Specifically designed for listing symbols contained within object files.
- `readelf`: Primarily focused on analyzing ELF object files.
- `dumpbin`: Tool for examining Microsoft Portable Executable (PE) files.

ELF Structure:

The ELF file format stores information in sections, which consist of:

1. Header: Describes the overall structure of the ELF file, including information about the target architecture, ABI, and locations of other sections.
2. Optional Program Headers: Describe the layout of the executable or shared object file in memory. Only applicable to executable and shared object files.
3. Sections: Organize the data within the object file. Each section contains a specific type of data, such as instructions or initialized data.
4. Section Header Table: Points to the individual sections and provides meta-information, such as the sectionâ€™s name, type, flags, and offset within the file.

Symbol Table:

An ELF Symbol Table stores information about symbols used within the program, including:

1. Name: A unique identifier for the symbol.
2. Value: Represents the offset within the section where the symbol is located.
3. Size: Denotes the size of the symbol in bytes.
4. Type: Defines whether the symbol is a function (func) or an object (variable, etc.) (object).
5. Section Index: Refers to the section in which the symbol is defined.

Linking Process:

When combining object files during the linking process, the linker performs several tasks, including:

1. Resolving external references between modules.
2. Adjusting offsets and addresses based on the final load address of the executable.
3. Performing consistency checks, such as verifying proper alignment and checking for duplicate definitions.
4. Creating a final executable image by merging the object files and incorporating necessary runtime information.
